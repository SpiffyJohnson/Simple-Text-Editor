To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them.

To die, to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to.

'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.
To die, to sleep; to sleep, perchance to dream—ay,
there's the rub: for in that sleep of death what dreams
May come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause:

There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin?

Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat
Under a weary life, but that the dread
Of something after death, the undiscover'd country
From whose bourn no traveller returns,
Puts him to things inconceivable?—deaths

eternal sleep, which can never be disjoin'd
From death's dark veil. Ay, there's the riddle! There's
the answer here: only endurance of that eventuality.

Ay, but what noise do I hear? What discord is in my ears?
What souring of the scent of sweetest balm;
What more I am than a wretched man, whose very thoughts begin to rot.
A plague o' both your houses!
